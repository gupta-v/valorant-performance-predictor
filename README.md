## Project Overview

Valorant Performance Prediction aims to analyze and model player statistics to predict performance metric win percentage. The project follows a machine learning pipeline, including data ingestion, cleaning, preprocessing, and model training.

## Uses and Scope

The _Valorant Performance Prediction_ project is a powerful tool for Valorant players, offering insights and analysis that can enhance strategic decision-making and gameplay:

- **Performance Analysis**: Players can input various game statistics and scenarios to analyze potential outcomes, understanding how different factors impact their performance.
- **Win Probability Estimation**: By providing a predicted win percentage, users can make data-driven decisions about their gameplay, such as agent selection and weapon usage.
- **Scenario Simulation**: The model allows for the simulation of different in-game situations, helping players experiment with strategies and observe their effects on win probability.
- **Community Engagement**: Content creators and analysts can use the project to engage the gaming community with data-driven content like match predictions and strategic breakdowns.
- **Future Extensions**: The project can be extended to include features like real-time data analysis, integration with gaming APIs, or expanded predictive capabilities.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- **Python**: Version 3.7 or higher
- **pip**: Ensure `pip` is installed for managing project dependencies

### Installation

- Clone the repository:

  ```sh
  git clone https://github.com/gupta-v/valorant-performance-predict.git
  ```

- Navigate to the project directory:

  ```sh
  cd valorant-performance-predict
  ```

- Install the required packages using requirements.txt:

  ```sh
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

## Data Description

The data used in this project (val_stats.csv) includes various player statistics, such as:

- headshots: Number of headshots
- kills: Number of kills
- deaths: Number of deaths
- assists: Number of assists
- agent_1, agent_2, agent_3: Agents played
- gun1_name, gun1_head, gun1_body: Gun Details
- Additional columns representing performance metrics and weapon usage

## Usage

### Running the Model Training Pipeline

- Ensure all dependencies are installed.
- Run train model step of the pipeline using the script provided in the steps folder.
  ```sh
  python steps/model_training.py
  ```
- The model will be trained and saved in the model.pkl file.
- The scaler and label encoders will be saved in the scaler.pkl and label_encoders.pkl file.

### Running the Streamlit Application

- Navigate to the App directory:
  ```sh
  cd App
  ```
- Run the Streamlit application using the command:
  ```sh
  streamlit run stream-lit-app.py
  ```
- The application will be hosted on local server.
  - Open your browser and go to http://localhost:8501 to use the web interface.

## Project Steps

### 1. Data Ingestion:

- Script: data_ingestion.py
- Description: Loads the player statistics data from data/val_stats.csv using pandas and logs the data loading process.

### 2. Data Cleaning:

- Script: data_cleaning.py
- Description: Cleans the data by dropping unnecessary columns, filling missing values, and converting data types for numerical processing.

### 3. Data Preprocessing:

- Script: datapreprocessing.py
- Description: Processes the data by calculating performance ratios, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical features. The data is split into training and testing sets.

### 4. Model Training:

- Script: model_training.py
- Description: Trains a Gradient Boosting Regressor on the preprocessed data, evaluates its performance using RMSE and R² score, and saves the model, scaler, and encoders.

### Model Evaluation

- The model's performance was evaluated using the test set, and the results are as follows:

- Metrics Used:

  - #### Mean Squared Error (MSE): 13.12
    - MSE measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values. A lower MSE indicates that the model's predictions are close to the actual values.
  - #### Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 3.62
    - RMSE is the square root of MSE and provides the error magnitude in the same units as the target variable. A lower RMSE signifies better model accuracy.
  - #### R² Score: 0.8945
    - The R² score indicates that the model explains approximately 89.45% of the variance in the target variable, showcasing its strong predictive power.

- The model's performance metrics are automatically evaluated and printed to the console when you run the training script i.e `model_training.py`.

## Future Enhancements

- Incorporate additional features to improve prediction accuracy.
- Experiment with different regression models and hyperparameters.
- Implement cross-validation for better model evaluation.
- Develop a more comprehensive front-end interface.
